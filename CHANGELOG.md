# CHANGELOG

## 2026-06-23 (v1.0.16 — reading progress bar reaches the top edge on notch/Dynamic Island)
- **fix(ios): the reading progress bar sat below the Dynamic Island / notch instead of at the
  true top edge.** Without `viewport-fit=cover`, iOS Safari lays the page out inside the safe area,
  so the bar's `top: 0` landed at the top of the *content* area (under the island), looking like it
  floated mid-screen. Set `viewportFit: 'cover'` in `generateViewport` so the page fills under the
  island and the fixed bar reaches the real top edge, and added `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding on
  `body` so the header/content re-clear the island (env() is 0 on devices without insets, so no
  effect elsewhere). `v1.0.16`.
- **docs(readme): rewrote "What it is"** to lead with the actual pitch — open-source (MIT),
  built for people who just want to **write**, **fast load on mobile + desktop**, **readable
  typography**, and **easy to tweak from the admin with no hardcoded values**. Gave the feature
  table a real header row (`Area | What you get`) instead of the blank `&nbsp;` cells.
- **docs(readme): both "Get your own" paths now open by default** (the AI-agent path was
  collapsed and easy to miss). **The agent path now has the agent walk the owner through creating
  the Google OAuth "Web" client** (Cloud Console clicks, consent screen, redirect URI) and collect
  the client ID/secret back, instead of telling the owner to pre-create it alone. `v1.0.15`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.14 — fix Backups card stuck on "Connect" after connecting)
- **fix(backup): the Backups card kept showing "Connect Google Drive" after a successful
  connect** (and "Back up now" stayed disabled). Root cause: the `backup_state` read is Data-Cache-
  eligible (tag `db`, 1h), and the connect write (`setDriveAuth`) didn't `revalidateTag('db')`, so
  `GET /api/backup` served the stale pre-connect "not connected" state until the cache expired.
  `setDriveAuth` / `clearDriveAuth` / `setFolderId` / `recordRun` now bust the `db` tag, so the
  admin reflects connect / disconnect / run / last-status immediately (confirmed via Supabase API
  logs: no `backup_state` re-read occurred after the connect writes). Also added a focus/visibility
  refetch to `BackupFields` so it re-syncs after the OAuth round-trip. `v1.0.14`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.13 — fix Drive connect redirect + tidy Backups layout)
- **fix(backup): `redirect_uri_mismatch` connecting Google Drive.** The consent + token-exchange
  redirect URI was built from `req.nextUrl.origin`, which is a `*.vercel.app` host when the admin
  is reached there (sign-in still works because NextAuth uses `AUTH_URL`) — so it didn't match the
  one URI registered on the OAuth client. New `backupRedirectUri(settings)` derives it from the
  canonical `resolveSiteUrl(settings)` (e.g. `https://manhhung.me/api/backup/callback`), used by
  both `/api/backup/connect` and `/api/backup/callback`. Register that exact URI on the client.
- **ui(backup): the Backups card no longer spans full width.** It now sits in the same two-column
  Advanced grid as MCP + custom CSS, so the section reads evenly. `v1.0.13`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.12 — slugified taxonomy URLs + clearer Overview)
- **fix(seo): category/tag URLs now use the slugified term**, e.g. `/category/suy-nghi` instead of
  `/category/Suy%20ngh%C4%A9`. New `lib/taxonomy.ts` (`termSlug`/`resolveTerm`); post-footer links +
  sitemap emit `termSlug(term)`; the four `category|tag/[slug]` routes resolve the slug back to the
  term (by `slugify` match) and `notFound()` on no match. **Old `%`-encoded URLs still resolve**
  (back-compat raw-term match) so nothing 404s. OG/metadata show the real term name.
- **feat(admin): Overview is clearer.** The media stat card now reads **Images** = original count,
  with a sub-line `N variants · M files` (variants = derived `-thumb`/`-1024`/`-1600` AVIF/WebP;
  files = `files/` blobs) instead of one opaque "Attachments" total. Category/Tag cards show their
  **total count** in the title. The System panel adds **MCP server** (on/off) and **Backups**
  (on when enabled + Drive connected) rows. New `stat*`/`sys*` locale keys in all 6 languages. `v1.0.12`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.11 — full-site backups to Google Drive)
- **feat: full-site backup to the owner's Google Drive** (Admin → Settings → Advanced). One
  snapshot = a single self-contained `.tar.gz` — `db.json` (every text table) + `blob/<pathname>`
  (every binary) + `manifest.json`. Automatic on a schedule (cron, every `intervalDays`, default
  4) with retention (keep the newest `keep`, default 4), plus **Back up now / Restore / Delete**
  in the admin. New `lib/backup.ts` + `lib/gdrive.ts` + `lib/backup-state.ts`; routes
  `/api/backup` (status/run/delete), `/api/backup/restore`, `/api/backup/{connect,callback,disconnect}`.
  Cron (`/api/cron`) calls `maybeRunBackup()`.
- **Drive auth is separate from sign-in.** A dedicated `drive.file` OAuth consent (reuses the
  Google client; login scope untouched) stores a refresh token in the new **`backup_state`** table
  (single row). The token is a SECRET and is kept OUT of `settings.data` (which is sent to the
  client) — only non-secret config (`enabled`/`intervalDays`/`keep`) rides in `settings.backups`;
  status + the snapshot list come from owner-only `/api/backup` (never the token).
- **Restore** replaces every text table (settings upserted; others delete-all + insert with
  `id`/generated `search` stripped) and re-uploads every blob; a pre-restore snapshot is taken
  first. New `backups` activity actions; new `backup*` admin locale keys in all 6 languages; new
  `tar` dependency. Owner one-time setup: enable the Google Drive API + add the callback redirect
  URI to the OAuth client, then **Connect Google Drive**. `v1.0.11`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.10 — hardening: edge guard, Google-only, MCP token expiry)
- **feat(security): `src/middleware.ts` edge owner-guard (defense-in-depth).** Reads the NextAuth
  JWT and blocks `/admin/:path*` (→ sign-in) and owner-only `/api/:path*` (→ 401) BEFORE the route
  runs — so a new admin page or API route is protected even if it forgets `requireOwner()`. Self-
  authed/public paths are allow-listed (`/api/auth`, `/api/cron`, `/api/track`, `/api/search`,
  `/api/mcp` except `/api/mcp/tokens`); add new public/bearer routes to `isPublicApi()`.
- **change(auth): Google is now the ONLY sign-in provider.** Dropped the GitHub OAuth provider
  (`auth.ts`, `.env.example`, README). `AUTH_GITHUB_ID/SECRET` are no longer read.
- **feat(security): MCP tokens now expire 180 days after creation.** New `mcp_tokens.expires_at`
  column (migration `mcp_tokens_add_expires_at`; default in `schema.sql`); `createToken` /
  `mintOAuthToken` set it on insert; `verifyTokenHash` rejects an expired bearer. The admin token
  table shows an **Expires** column (red "Expired" when past). Connectors silently re-authorize
  across the boundary; a manual token must be recreated. New locale keys `mcpColExpires` / `mcpExpired`
  in all 6 languages. The admin remains the sole authority over deletion. `v1.0.10`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.9 — every error page shares one look)
- **refactor: all error/edge screens now route through ONE `ErrorScreen` component** so they can't
  drift. The public 404, the 5xx boundaries (`ErrorView`), and a new **admin 404**
  (`app/admin/not-found.tsx`, for unmatched admin URLs) all render the identical layout (number +
  title + text + actions on theme tokens) — fully consistent per request. Shared `ERROR_LINK` class.
- The public 404 keeps the blog header/footer; the admin 404 renders in the admin shell. (Other 4xx
  like 401/403 stay auth redirects/JSON by design, not pages.) `v1.0.9`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.8 — fix stale admin lists + 5xx/error pages)
- **fix(admin): admin list endpoints showed STALE data (the real "can't delete a token" bug).**
  `db()` GET reads are Data-Cache-eligible (tag `db`, 1h). The admin client-fetched list routes
  weren't `force-dynamic`, so after a delete/upload the cached list still showed the old rows — the
  MCP token list kept showing a just-deleted token, so re-clicking Delete was a no-op on a dead id
  (only toggling MCP off, which calls `revalidateTag('db')`, refreshed it). Marked **`force-dynamic`**
  on every owner-only list route so they always read live: `mcp/tokens`, `files`, `media`,
  `media/unused`, `posts/[slug]/revisions`. Deleting a connection from the admin now takes effect
  immediately, as intended.
- **fix(admin): corrected `api/media` GET header comment** (said "public read" — it is owner-only).
- **feat: 5xx / error pages now match the 404.** Added `error.tsx` (per-segment) + `(blog)/error.tsx`
  (keeps the public shell) + `global-error.tsx` (root-layout failures), all rendering a shared
  `ErrorView` styled identically to the 404 (number + title + text + Try again / Back home, on theme
  tokens). New locale keys `errorTitle`/`errorText`/`tryAgain` in all 6 languages. `v1.0.8`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.7 — MCP: admin is the sole authority over a connection)
- **change(mcp): OAuth tokens are NEVER auto-deleted.** Removed the rolling-window prune
  (`MAX_OAUTH_TOKENS`) — the system no longer removes connections behind the owner's back.
  Lifecycle rule now matches intent: a connection **persists forever** (eternal token, no expiry,
  no prune) until the **owner deletes it in the admin**; an admin delete is final unless the owner
  re-authorizes. Deleting the connector in Claude alone just lets it re-authorize (a new token row;
  the old one persists until the owner removes it). `v1.0.7`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.6 — MCP token list always reflects reality)
- **fix(admin): the MCP token list no longer shows a stale snapshot.** It loaded only on mount, so
  connecting/disconnecting in Claude (out-of-band) left the admin list wrong — "can't delete the old
  one", "don't see the new one". It now **refetches on tab focus / visibility change** and has a
  manual **Refresh** button, so the owner always sees and can revoke every live token/connection.
- **fix(mcp): prune the OAuth rolling window by `id` (monotonic PK), not `created_at`** — removes a
  tie risk where a freshly minted token could be pruned. `v1.0.6`.
- Note: deleting a connector's token revokes that session; the connector can only re-appear if the
  owner re-approves OAuth (authorize is gated by the owner's login). To fully stop access, also
  disconnect in Claude or turn the MCP toggle off.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.5 — MCP: authorize once, connect forever)
- **fix(mcp): connecting an OAuth connector once now works indefinitely.** The `/token` exchange
  used to delete the previous "OAuth connector" token on every connect (single slot), so any
  reconnect or second client stranded an earlier session on a dead token → "connected but zero
  tools". Now `mintOAuthToken` **never pre-deletes** (the in-use token survives a re-auth) and keeps
  a small rolling window (`MAX_OAUTH_TOKENS`), so reconnects can't strand a client. Tokens stay
  eternal (no expiry), so claude.ai authorizes once and never has to re-auth.
- **fix(mcp): OAuth tokens are exempt from the manual 5-token cap.** Authorizing can no longer fail
  with "limit reached"; the admin create-token cap counts manual tokens only (`McpTokenInfo.oauth`).
- **docs:** corrected the stale `api/mcp/route.ts` header (it still described a single `MCP_TOKEN`
  bearer) and the CLAUDE.md MCP section. `v1.0.5`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.4 — full-width admin + non-wrapping table headers)
- **feat(admin): admin pages now fill the browser width.** Dropped the `max-w-6xl` lock on the
  admin content column (no longer needed with the column/sidebar layout) — content is full width
  with ~100px gutters on desktop (`lg:px-[100px]`), tighter padding on mobile (`px-4`, `sm:px-6`).
  The fixed save bars (post/page editor, settings) align to the same gutters.
- **fix(admin): table column headers no longer wrap.** Added `whitespace-nowrap` to every admin
  table header row (posts, pages, trash, activity log); columns auto-size to content (auto table
  layout) instead of squeezing a header onto two lines.
- **polish(admin): mobile spacing.** Re-tuned the content gutters/top padding for phones alongside
  the width change. `v1.0.4`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.3 — slim down: dead scripts + deps + comments)
- **chore: removed `@vercel/analytics`.** It duplicated the built-in cookieless analytics and
  shipped extra client JS; dropped the `<Analytics/>` tag + the package. The custom analytics
  (`analytics.ts`, Admin → Analytics) is unchanged.
- **chore: moved 12 pre-Supabase one-off scripts to `scripts/legacy/`** (kept for recovery, not
  deleted). Their parser deps (`gray-matter` → devDeps, `turndown`/`turndown-plugin-gfm`/
  `fast-xml-parser` already dev) no longer sit in production `dependencies`.
- **docs: trimmed verbose comments** across the data layer (`media`/`files`/`posts`/`settings`/
  `blob`/`themes`/`revalidate`) + `layout.tsx` / `PostContent.tsx` to terse, AI-readable notes —
  GOTCHAs and the "why" behind non-obvious decisions kept. No behavior change. `v1.0.3`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.2 — collapsible sidebar + admin polish)
- **feat(admin): the sidebar is now collapsible and icon-led.** Each nav item has an icon
  (`navIcons.tsx`); the rail is narrower (`w-52`, was `w-60`) and a toggle collapses it to
  icon-only (`w-16`), persisted in localStorage and remembered across navigation. Collapsed items
  show a tooltip; the footer controls switch to icon-only too. The fixed settings/editor save bars
  follow the rail via a `--admin-nav-w` CSS variable (no hardcoded offset). All monochrome — no
  hardcoded accent colors/fonts/text sizes, per the project rules.
- **polish(admin): softer cards + a mobile-safe analytics grid.** Added a subtle `shadow-sm` to the
  admin card containers (lifts white cards off the gray canvas, matching the reference) and made the
  Analytics summary cards stack on phones (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3`) instead of cramming three
  across. `v1.0.2`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.1 — admin-managed MCP + left sidebar)
- **feat(mcp): MCP is now toggled + tokenized from the admin.** Replaced the single `MCP_TOKEN`
  env var with an Admin → Settings → Advanced panel: an **enable toggle** (`settings.mcp.enabled`)
  and an **access-token manager** — generate up to **5 named tokens**, each shown **once** on
  creation (only its SHA-256 hash is stored in a new `mcp_tokens` table), with last-used time and
  one-click revoke. `verifyMcpToken` now checks the bearer's hash against live tokens while the
  toggle is on. The OAuth `/token` exchange mints a managed token (named "OAuth connector",
  refreshed per connect) instead of returning a static secret. New owner-only
  `/api/mcp/tokens` (+ `/[id]`) routes; activity actions `mcp.token.create|delete`.
- **feat(admin): left vertical sidebar nav.** The admin top bar grew too crowded, so navigation
  moved to a sticky left sidebar (brand → links → theme/palette/cache/sign-out pinned at the
  bottom), with active-route highlighting; it collapses to a hamburger drawer on mobile. New
  `AdminSidebar` (replaces `AdminHeader`); shared `SIDEBAR_NAV` constant keeps every item uniform.
- **change(settings): "Text rendering" moved from Advanced → Appearance.** Font smoothing now sits
  with the other appearance controls; Advanced holds the MCP panel + custom CSS. `v1.0.1`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.0 — MCP server + Trash)
First stable release: the blog can now be operated by an AI agent over MCP, and every
delete is recoverable via a Trash.

### MCP server
- **feat(mcp): remote MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP).** An MCP client (Claude,
  ChatGPT, …) can operate the blog through the SAME data layer as the admin UI — tools to
  list/get/create/update/delete(→Trash)/restore posts and pages, manage media + files (incl.
  `add_media_from_url`), read taxonomy, and read settings. Content is Markdown verbatim (no
  conversion). Tools live in `src/lib/mcp`; built on `mcp-handler` + `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **feat(mcp): one full-access token + a thin OAuth layer.** Auth is a single bearer
  `MCP_TOKEN` ("one token, full power"); connectors that require OAuth obtain it via a minimal
  OAuth 2.1 flow (authorization-code + PKCE) gated by the owner's existing NextAuth login —
  `/api/mcp/{authorize,token,register}` + `/.well-known/oauth-{protected-resource,authorization-server}`.
  Unset `MCP_TOKEN` disables the endpoint entirely.
- **feat(mcp): sensitive settings are blocked.** `get_settings` reads everything, but
  `update_settings` exposes only a safe allowlist (title / description / showDescription) — theme,
  fonts, typography, menu, domain, SEO, language and logos cannot be changed over MCP.

### Trash / soft delete
- **feat(trash): every delete is now a soft delete to a recoverable Trash.** Posts, pages, media
  and files gain a nullable `deleted_at` column (NULL = live, timestamp = trashed). Deleting from
  anywhere (admin tables, media/file libraries, multi-select, "delete all unused") now MOVES the
  item to Trash instead of destroying it — every live read filters `deleted_at is null`, so trashed
  items vanish from the site, lists, search, sitemap/feed/llms and the libraries. Media/file soft
  delete KEEPS the blob, so a published post that links a trashed image keeps rendering; nothing is
  removed from Blob until an explicit purge. A trashed row keeps its slug (still reserved) so
  restore always works.
- **feat(trash): new Admin → Trash page (`/admin/trash`).** Four tabs (Posts / Pages / Media /
  Files), each its own list with **Restore** + **Delete permanently**, plus **Empty trash** per
  tab. Nothing auto-purges — permanent removal is manual only. New unified `POST /api/trash`
  (`{ kind, action: restore|purge|empty, ids? }`), owner-gated; restores revalidate the item's
  surfaces, media/file purges revalidate everything (blobs removed). New activity actions
  (`*.restore` / `*.purge` / `trash.empty`). i18n synced across all 6 locales. `v1.0.0`.

## 2026-06-22 (fix: duplicate favicon)
- **fix(favicon): emit exactly one `<link rel="icon">`.** Next auto-injects a `<link>` for
  `app/favicon.ico` **in addition to** the metadata `icons.icon`, so the page shipped two
  conflicting favicons (the bundled `vb` default declaring `sizes="256x256"` + the owner's custom
  one) and browsers often picked the wrong/bundled one — the custom favicon looked like it wasn't
  loading. Moved the default to `public/favicon.ico` (no auto-inject) and drive the icon solely via
  `generateMetadata` (`settings.faviconUrl || '/favicon.ico'`). `v0.9.29`.

## 2026-06-22 (audit fixes: self-hosted font, link hardening)
- **fix(build): self-host Inter — no more Google Fonts dependency.** Replaced `next/font/google`
  (which fetched Inter at build → broke offline / restricted-CI / Google-outage builds) with
  self-hosted variable woff2 (`public/fonts/`, subsetted by `unicode-range` in `globals.css`). The
  OG image already self-hosts the same Inter as `.woff`, so the whole app is now Google-free; one
  typeface everywhere, fully local. The latin subset is preloaded.
- **fix(security): sanitize link hrefs.** `PostContent` now drops `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:`
  link schemes (marked v5+ stopped sanitizing) — `[x](javascript:…)` no longer renders an
  executable href. Raw HTML was already escaped, so this closes the remaining vector.
- **fix(toc): de-dupe heading ids.** Two identical headings used to emit the same `id` (broken ToC
  anchors); now 2nd → `foo-2`, 3rd → `foo-3`, with `PostContent` and `extractHeadings` sharing the
  counter so anchors line up.
- **fix(auth): normalize the owner email** (trim + lowercase both sides) so a provider returning a
  different case / stray whitespace can't lock the owner out.
- **fix(images): parse image-placement fragments as exact tokens** (`#left`/`#right`/`#wide`/
  `#left-wide`) so a stray fragment like `#bright` no longer matches `right`.
- **chore: add `typecheck` script** (`tsc --noEmit`). `v0.9.28`.

## 2026-06-22 (docs: slim CLAUDE.md)
- **docs(claude): CLAUDE.md 560 → 358 lines (−36%) with zero rules lost.** Deduped the "why"
  (delegated to ARCHITECTURE.md via a header note), deleted the standalone Portability section
  (its rule lives in Blob; rationale in ARCHITECTURE), compressed the data-layer table + the
  descriptive sections (SEO/Editor/Settings/PWA/etc.) to essentials, and collapsed the legacy
  scripts table to a one-line list. Every HARD RULE and GOTCHA kept verbatim (caching DO-NOTs,
  header `h-9`/no-`items-baseline`, one-font + grep checks, `hr{margin:0}`, i18n sync, versioning).
- **docs(claude): fixed a stale contradiction** — removed the dangling "`blob.ts` readJson/readText
  return fallback" line; those were already removed in P1.5 (the doc said so two sections earlier).

## 2026-06-22 (docs: DB schema + working principles)
- **docs(setup): added `scripts/schema.sql`** — the full Postgres schema (all 9 tables,
  indexes, the `posts.search` generated tsvector, RLS, and the `analytics_summary`/
  `analytics_totals` RPCs), transcribed from the live database. Self-hosters can now create
  the whole DB in one run; previously the repo had no schema at all (the migration script
  assumed the tables existed). Idempotent.
- **docs(readme): rewrote the install guide** — a step-by-step **Local setup** (prerequisites,
  clone → run `schema.sql` → Supabase keys → Blob token → OAuth app → env → run) and added the
  missing **Supabase / `schema.sql`** step to both Vercel deploy paths (manual + AI agent).
- **docs(claude): added a "Working principles" section** (think-before-coding, simplicity,
  surgical changes, goal-driven verification) at the top of CLAUDE.md, adapted to this repo —
  notably that verification = `npm run build` + `npm run lint` (no test suite). Pure docs — no
  version bump.

## 2026-06-22 (auto-sized header logo)
- **feat(logo): the header logo is auto-compressed to the chosen size.** The owner's picked logo
  (`logoUrl`) is ALWAYS kept untouched; on every settings save we (re)build one small WebP scaled to
  the header width at **2x for retina** (`renderLogo` in `lib/files.ts`, via sharp, never upscaled
  past the source) and serve THAT in the header (`logoRenderUrl`). The previous derived file is
  deleted each regeneration, so exactly one ever lives on the store (under `files/logo-*.webp`, hidden
  from every grid). Regenerates only when the source or `logoWidth` changes (or none exists yet);
  cleared when the logo is removed/hidden. Vector (svg) / animated (gif) logos are served as-is (no
  derived file). Cuts the header image payload from the full-size original to a few KB — the main
  PageSpeed "image delivery" win.
- **fix(cls): the logo now reserves its space.** The `<img>` carries `width`+`height` (`logoRenderHeight`
  = displayed height at `logoWidth`), so the header no longer shifts as the logo loads. `v0.9.27`.

## 2026-06-22 (one-font rule — absolute, no exceptions)
- **change(typography): one typeface for EVERYTHING, hard rule.** Removed the last monospace
  spots in admin (hex inputs, raw-Markdown source editor, code-token button, activity badge) — the
  whole app, public and admin, now renders in the single site font (`--font-sans`); `grep font-mono
  src` is empty.
- **feat(og): the OG image follows the custom font too.** When the owner uploads a font, `lib/og.ts`
  appends `?font=<blobUrl>` and the `/og` route renders the card in it (Blob host only, SSRF-guarded;
  Inter stays the glyph fallback). With no custom font it stays Inter — so the share image always
  matches the site's one font.
- **docs:** recorded the rule (one font + zero hardcoded font/size, everywhere incl. admin + OG; a
  custom font governs the whole site) in CLAUDE.md conventions + the Typography/OG sections. `v0.9.26`.

## 2026-06-22 (type scale re-tuned + one font everywhere)
- **change(typography): smaller, calmer default scale.** List-card titles (H2) were reading as
  banners — the whole scale was re-tuned down to a restrained ~1.18 ratio off an 18px body:
  `h1 1.95 / h2 1.4 / h3 1.2 / h4 1.15 / h5 0.9 rem` (was `2.26 / 1.74 / 1.45 / 1.24 / 0.9`),
  with line-heights/letter-spacing balanced per role for long-form reading. Reset restores these.
- **change(typography): one typeface for everything.** Code blocks + inline code now reuse the
  site font (Inter or the uploaded face) instead of a separate monospace stack — no font family
  is ever auto-added on the reading site. (Admin keeps functional monospace for the hex inputs +
  raw-Markdown source editor, a deliberate tool affordance.)
- **chore(typography): full site sweep, no stray hardcoded sizes.** Search inputs now use the
  `.fs-h2`/`.fs-h3` roles; the only remaining fixed public sizes are the brand wordmark and the
  404 numeral (deliberate display). Admin's arbitrary `text-[10px]/[11px]` badges normalized to
  `text-xs`; admin chrome otherwise stays on Tailwind's standard scale by design (it must NOT
  resize when the owner tunes the reader's content sizes). `v0.9.25`.

## 2026-06-21 (full per-role typography + per-weight fonts)
- **feat(typography): every text role fully tunable, zero hardcoded sizes.** Nine roles —
  h1–h5, body, small (dates/meta/related/ToC/pagination/search), caption, code — each with its
  own **size / line-height / letter-spacing**, emitted as CSS vars (`--fs-*`, `--lh-*`, `--ls-*`).
  All public reading + secondary text now maps to a role (new `.t-small` utility replaced every
  `text-sm`); only brand wordmark, search box, and the 404 numeral stay as deliberate one-offs.
  Defaults are tuned to read well; reset restores them exactly.
- **feat(typography): custom font per weight.** Four upload slots (Regular 400 / Medium 500 /
  SemiBold 600 / Bold 700) sharing one family — one `@font-face` per weight, so headings/bold are
  crisp (the site disables faux-bold). `POST /api/files/font` takes a `weight`; `settings.customFont`
  is now `{ family, faces[] }`. Old single-file shape migrates to the 400 slot.
- **change(admin): Settings tabs finalized** — Appearance holds colors + font (4 slots) + the
  per-role text-size table; Advanced holds the font-smoothing toggle + custom CSS. `v0.9.24`.

## 2026-06-21 (fonts + typography controls + settings tabs)
- **feat(typography): custom font upload.** Admin → Settings → Appearance can upload a typeface
  (`.woff2/.woff/.ttf/.otf`); it's stored on Blob under `files/` (separate from the media grid),
  registered via `@font-face`, and applied site-wide (`--font-sans`, Inter stays the fallback).
  `POST /api/files/font` → `{ url, family }`; `settings.customFont`. Remove restores Inter.
- **feat(typography): body size + reading rhythm + smoothing.** The scale now also covers normal
  body text (`--fs-base`); new controls for **line spacing** (`--lh-body`), **letter spacing**
  (`--ls-body`), and a **font-smoothing (anti-alias)** toggle. Stored in `settings.typography`,
  injected as a `:root` override; each group has its own reset-to-default.
- **change(admin): Settings split into 3 tabs** — General, Appearance, Advanced. Colors + font +
  text sizes live under Appearance; spacing/smoothing + custom CSS under Advanced. `v0.9.23`.

## 2026-06-21 (typography follow-up)
- **change(typography): list cards use H2, not H1.** Single post/page titles (and category/tag
  list-page headings) stay H1; post titles inside listings step down to H2 so the listing reads
  calmer. `v0.9.22`.

## 2026-06-21 (typography scale)
- **feat(typography): one site-wide heading scale (H1–H5), no hardcoded sizes.** Heading
  sizes now flow from five CSS variables (`--fs-h1`…`--fs-h5`) instead of per-element
  `text-[…]` values. Defaults follow the owner's spec — H1 ≈ 30% larger than H2, H2 20%
  larger than before (and 20% larger than H3), H4 10% larger than body text, H5 20% smaller
  (body = 1.125rem): `2.26 / 1.74 / 1.45 / 1.24 / 0.9 rem`. **Every title** (single post,
  single page, list cards, category/tag list pages, draft preview) uses **H1**.
- **feat(editor): H4 + H5 buttons** in the post/page editor toolbar (alongside H1–H3); the
  public renderer + `.prose` now style `h4`/`h5`.
- **feat(settings): "Heading sizes" card** (Admin → Settings) to customize each level (rem)
  with a live preview and a **reset-to-default** button. Stored in `settings.typography`,
  injected as a `:root` override after `globals.css`. `v0.9.21`.

## 2026-06-21 (uploads)
- **fix(media/files): browser-direct uploads — large files no longer fail.** Images and
  attachments now upload straight from the browser to Vercel Blob (`/api/media/blob-token` +
  `/api/media/register`, `/api/files/blob-token` + `/api/files/register`), bypassing the
  serverless **4.5MB request-body limit** that was silently dropping bigger files. The metadata
  is registered server-side (dimensions + thumbnail fetched back for images), the new item
  appears in the grid/list immediately (no refresh), and success/failure is always reported.
  Removed the old `POST /api/media/upload` and `POST /api/files`. `v0.9.20`.

## 2026-06-21 (analytics follow-up)
- **feat(analytics): scroll-depth / average read %.** A `<ScrollDepth/>` beacon on posts sends
  the max % of the page reached on leave (`analytics_scroll` table); the dashboard shows an
  overall "avg. read depth" and a per-page % in Top pages. `v0.9.19`.
- **feat(analytics): 24-hour range (hourly buckets).** New 24h option before 7d; the chart
  buckets by hour for it (day otherwise), via a `bucket` arg on `analytics_summary`. `v0.9.19`.
- **feat(admin): View column on the content tables.** Posts and Pages now show all-time total
  views per item (`analytics_totals` RPC → `getViewTotals`). `v0.9.19`.
- **change(analytics): keep events forever.** Dropped the 1-year cron purge — the full history
  is retained. `v0.9.19`.
- **change(admin): Analytics moved next to the home tab** in the admin nav. `v0.9.19`.

## 2026-06-21 (admin + analytics batch)
- **feat(analytics): self-hosted, cookieless page-view analytics.** New Postgres
  `analytics_events` table + `analytics_summary` RPC, a fire-and-forget `<Track/>` beacon
  (`POST /api/track`, runs after the response, never makes a page dynamic), and an
  **Admin → Analytics** page: total views, unique visitors, a daily bar series, and top
  pages over 7d / 30d / 1y. Visitors are counted by a salted IP+user-agent hash — no
  cookies, no PII stored; bots and admin/api paths are dropped. The hourly cron purges
  events older than a year. `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(admin): multi-select delete in the library.** Checkboxes + "Delete selected" on
  both the Images grid and the Files list (atomic batch delete; new `deleteFilesBatch` +
  `POST /api/files/delete`). `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(admin): Files tab lists the site icons.** The favicon / app icon uploaded in
  Settings now appear in a read-only group (tagged "Settings", `getSiteIcons` +
  `GET /api/files/icons`). An intro under the Library title explains image versions vs
  files-as-is. `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(admin): richer System panel.** The Overview system card now shows the live URL,
  branch, framework + Node runtime, and deep-links to the Vercel dashboard, Blob stores,
  the Supabase project, and the GitHub commit. `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(public): search opens in an overlay.** The header search icon opens a modal
  search-in-place (instant local title/tag + debounced body FTS) instead of navigating to
  `/search` (which still exists for deep links / no-JS). New `GET /api/search/index` serves
  the lean index. `v0.9.18`.

## 2026-06-21 (later)
- **style(post): match the single-post title to the list card title.** The `/[slug]` post
  heading now uses the same size + weight as the home/list card title (`text-[1.35rem]
  font-semibold`) so a post reads consistently from the listing into the article. `v0.9.17`.

## 2026-06-21
- **perf(images): intrinsic width/height + eager LCP image.** Body images now render with their
  stored pixel dimensions (from the `media` table) so the browser reserves the box before bytes
  arrive — eliminates layout shift (CLS). The first body image loads eagerly with
  `fetchpriority=high` (likely the LCP element) instead of lazily. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(reading): server-side syntax highlighting (Shiki).** Code blocks are highlighted at
  render with Shiki (Vitesse light/dark, muted to fit the minimal surface) — zero client JS.
  Dual-theme tokens swap with the site's dark mode via CSS. Unknown languages / failures fall
  back to the plain escaped block. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(search): full-text search over the article body.** The public search now also queries
  the Postgres `search` tsvector (`/api/search`, `websearch_to_tsquery('simple')`) so matches
  inside post bodies surface, merged after the instant local title/tag results. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(admin): filter + status tabs on the posts table.** A folded title/tag search box and an
  All/Published/Draft segmented control to find posts fast as the archive grows. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(reading): back-to-top button + wide-image mobile clamp.** A themed scroll-to-top button
  appears past the first viewport on posts; `img-wide` figures clamp to the column on phones so
  they never force horizontal scrolling. `v0.9.16`.

## 2026-06-22
- **fix(cache): tag Supabase reads + `revalidateTag('db')` on every save.** GET reads now carry
  the `db` tag (cache-eligible, so pages stay ISR); each write helper in `revalidate.ts` calls
  `revalidateTag('db','max')` alongside its `revalidatePath` superset, so a re-rendered page
  always reads fresh from Postgres — closes the window where an ISR page could serve up-to-1h
  stale data after an edit. `v0.9.15`.
- **feat(media): cron backfills missing thumbnails.** `finalizePendingThumbs` generates a
  `-thumb.webp` for any media row without a thumb (e.g. migration imports), so the library grid
  never has to load full-size originals. Runs hourly with the variant sweep. `v0.9.15`.
- **chore: code + docs cleanup after the Supabase move.** Removed the dead vanity-domain
  priming (`getSettings()` calls in read paths), tidied the data layer, and rewrote the caching
  / Blob / data-model docs (CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE/README) to match the Postgres model; legacy
  `_index.json` scripts flagged as pre-migration. `v0.9.15`.
- **fix(media): render the canonical lowercase Blob host.** The store id is mixed-case in the
  token but the public host is lowercase; `blobBase()` now lowercases it so image URLs are
  canonical (avoids uppercase/lowercase duplicate-URL SEO). `v0.9.14`.
- **change(media): drop the vanity media domain — serve images straight from Vercel Blob.**
  Removed the `mediaBaseUrl` setting + `BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE` env + the `setMediaBase`/`publicBase`
  machinery; `expandBlob`/`blobOrigin` now always use the Blob store host. Fixes broken
  thumbnails in the media library (the proxy returned a restrictive CSP), simplifies the data
  layer (removed the now-dead `getSettings()` priming from every read), and keeps content
  store-relative so a future move (e.g. → R2) is still just a token/base swap. `v0.9.13`.
- **feat(seo): image sitemap + Article image.** `sitemap.xml` now lists each post's images
  (`<image:image>`) and the post's `BlogPosting` JSON-LD carries an `image` (featured, else the
  first body image), so search engines associate every image with its manhhung.me page even
  though the files are on the Blob host. New `extractImageUrls` helper. `v0.9.13`.
- **feat(admin): activity log — transparent record of admin actions.** Every mutation
  (post/page create·update·delete, media/file upload·delete, icon upload, settings save,
  taxonomy change, cache clear) is recorded to a Postgres `activity_log` table and shown on
  a new **Admin → Log** page (newest first, with a Clear button). Logging is toggleable in
  Settings → Features (`activityLog`, default on); writes happen via `after()` so they never
  slow the action. New `src/lib/activity.ts`, `GET/DELETE /api/activity`. `v0.9.12`.
- **feat(admin): System panel on the Overview.** Shows hosting (Vercel) + region + environment
  + commit, the database (Supabase · region · ref) with a live reachability check, and the
  media storage host. `v0.9.12`.
- **fix(media): deleting an image now removes EVERY version, original included.** Delete attempts
  the original + thumbnail + all four display variants for any raster (idempotent / no-op when a
  file is absent), regardless of the `variants` flag, so nothing is ever left orphaned on the
  store. Upload already keeps the untouched original. `v0.9.12`.
- **feat(storage): move all TEXT content from Vercel Blob to Supabase Postgres (P1.5).** Posts,
  pages, revisions, media/file metadata and settings now live in Postgres tables; the
  `_index.json` manifests + `.md` files are gone. Binaries (images, attachments, icons) stay on
  Vercel Blob, referenced store-relative (still portable, e.g. to Cloudflare R2). This kills the
  whole class of no-DB bugs at the root: **deleted images can no longer "come back"** (each row
  delete is atomic — no concurrent manifest read-modify-write to clobber), reads are always
  fresh + transactional (no `?ts` cache-bust needed; removed), and **admin save is faster** —
  the read-modify-write of the manifest is now a single atomic upsert. New `src/lib/db.ts`
  (server-only `service_role` client; reads cache-eligible for ISR, writes `no-store`).
  A Postgres `tsvector` column is in place for future body search. Schema lives in the
  `vibeblog` Supabase project (ap-southeast-1). `v0.9.11`.
- **perf(save): display-variant (AVIF/WebP) encoding moved OFF the save request.** `savePost`/
  `savePage` return immediately after the DB write; `finalizeContentMedia` runs in the
  background via `after()` (the original always renders meanwhile). An hourly Vercel Cron
  (`/api/cron`) sweeps any still-pending variants AND keep-alives the Supabase free-tier
  project so it never pauses. `v0.9.11`.
- **fix(media): atomic batch delete — fixes "deleted unused images come back".** Root cause was
  a lost-update race, not matching: deleting several unused images fired separate requests that
  each read the same manifest and wrote their own copy, so the last write clobbered the earlier
  removals (a no-DB concurrency bug). New `deleteMediaBatch` removes ALL given URLs in ONE
  manifest read-modify-write (single delete now delegates to it), and a **"Delete all unused"**
  button (`POST /api/media/delete`) sweeps the whole unused set atomically. Blob-file cleanup is
  best-effort after the write and only touches variants that were actually generated (faster).
  `v0.9.10`.
- **fix(media): surface a silent no-match delete + add an owner diagnostic.** If the delete
  endpoint matched nothing (URL still present in the returned list), the library now shows an
  explicit error toast instead of leaving the image silently in place. Added owner-only
  `GET /api/media/debug?url=…` reporting the manifest size, the extracted match key, how many
  entries matched, a sample of stored URLs, and the configured media base — ground truth for a
  "stuck" delete. `v0.9.9`.
- **fix(media): delete now matches host-independently + writes manifest first.** Root-caused the
  "deleted image stays / re-appears in unused check" once more: the match relied on
  `collapseBlob` stripping the URL host, which silently found nothing if the primed host didn't
  equal the URL's host — so the manifest was never rewritten. Now `deleteMedia`/`deleteFile`
  match by the extracted `media/…` / `files/…` **pathname** (works for any host or a collapsed
  path, no `getSettings` priming needed), and write the reduced manifest **before** the blob-file
  cleanup so the removal sticks even if the (slower) file deletes stall. Dropped the per-delete
  settings read too (faster). `v0.9.8`.
- **style(theme): nicer public palette trigger icon** — replaced the swatch-grid glyph with
  three overlapping color circles (cleaner, clearly "color theme"). `v0.9.7`.
- **fix(media)/perf(admin): authoritative-from-write deletes (approach A).** The image/file
  delete endpoints now return the **true post-delete list, built from the in-memory manifest
  they just wrote — no Blob re-read** — and the library adopts it directly. This removes the
  read-after-write/eventual-consistency window that made a deleted image seem to "come back",
  and makes a failed server delete visible instead of silently optimistic. Hardened
  `deleteMedia`/`deleteFile`: only rewrite the manifest when an entry actually matched (never
  wipe it on a transient read failure), and sweep the original + thumb + all four display
  variants for any raster (regardless of the stored `variants` flag). `v0.9.6`.
- **chore: version in README title + repo link on the Overview pill.** The README H1 now
  carries the version (`# vibeblog (v0.9.x)`, kept in sync on each bump), and the admin
  Overview version pill links to the repo root (`/vibeblog`) instead of the releases page.
  `v0.9.5`.
- **feat(theme): polish the palette pickers + localize palette names.** Admin Settings →
  Appearance: the preset cards are more compact and spaced out, borderless — the selected
  palette reads via full opacity + a bold name while the rest sit dimmed (no rings/borders).
  Public switcher: a clearer swatch-grid trigger icon (the artist-palette glyph was ambiguous)
  and a wider preview chip that shows each palette's basic colors (heading/body/link/meta).
  Palette names (Mono/Sepia/Forest/Ocean/Rosé/Amber) are now **localized** via a `paletteNames`
  dict in all six admin + six public locales (no longer hardcoded in `themes.ts`).
- **chore(admin-nav): rename nav items.** "Pages / Posts" → **Content**; the appearance
  switcher now shows a fixed **"Appearance"** label instead of the current palette's name.
  Both across all six admin locales. `v0.9.4`.
- **feat(library): rename the media page to "Library" and split it into two tabs** — **Images**
  (the existing media library, unchanged) and **Files**, a new catch-all store for non-image
  attachments (PDF, zip, docx, audio…). Files upload to the `files/` Blob prefix with their own
  manifest (`files/_index.json`), with upload / copy-URL / download / delete; the site icons
  under `files/` (favicon, app icon) are excluded from the tab. New `GET/POST /api/files` +
  `DELETE /api/files/by`; nav label + page title updated across all six locales. `v0.9.3`.
- **fix(media): delete now removes ALL versions of an image from Blob and actually takes
  effect.** Two bugs in `deleteMedia`: (1) it didn't prime the vanity media base before
  `collapseBlob`, so when a custom media host was configured the deleted URL never collapsed to
  its `media/…` pathname — nothing matched and the delete silently no-op'd (the image stayed in
  the library, including "unused" items). (2) display variants (`-1024/-1600` AVIF+WebP) were
  only removed when the manifest `variants` flag was true, leaving orphans if it was stale. Now
  it primes settings first and unconditionally sweeps the thumb + all four variants for any
  raster original. `v0.9.2`.
- **docs(deploy): expanded the "Deploy to Vercel" guide into two clear methods** — (A) manual
  via the Vercel dashboard (fork → Blob store → env vars → OAuth callback → sign in), noting the
  two `vercel.json` settings to adjust for yourself (the `sin1` region is just the author's
  nearest region — change it; the 60s upload `maxDuration` can exceed the free plan); and (B) handing the whole
  install to an AI agent with Vercel + GitHub access (generic — OpenClaw / Hermes / Claude / …)
- **docs(license): make the code-vs-content split explicit.** The platform code stays
  **MIT** — free to use/modify/redistribute with **no attribution required**. Clarified that
  the blog **content** published with it (the author's writing/images, e.g. manhhung.me) is
  **© all rights reserved** and not covered by MIT. Added a "Scope" note to `LICENSE`, a
  two-layer README License section, `"license": "MIT"` in package.json, and an **MIT pill** on
  the admin Overview (links to the LICENSE) so the open-source status shows in-app too
- **chore(audit): add `audit/` log + repeatable audit procedure** (`audit/README.md`): an
  8-section pass (baseline → security → logic → perf → code quality → layout → i18n → docs)
  recorded as dated reports, so each comprehensive review starts from the last clean line.
  First report `audit/2026-06-22-comprehensive.md`. CLAUDE.md points to it; CHECKLIST gains a
  **Layout / visual** section (was missing despite the owner's alignment sensitivity)
- **fix(layout): de-duplicate the public header icon-button class into `ICON_BTN`**
  (`components/ui/iconButton.ts`). Search / palette / theme / menu each re-typed the same
  `h-10 w-10 … text-meta hover:bg-rule` string — a drift risk the "one shared class" rule
  forbids; now all four import the constant (same pattern as `ADMIN_NAV`)
- **chore: full project audit (tech / security / perf / logic) — clean.** No vulnerabilities or
  logic bugs found: every write/delete route is owner-gated, palette colors are hex-validated
  before the `<style>` emit, custom CSS strips `</style`, raw HTML in markdown is escaped,
  preview tokens use `timingSafeEqual`, RSS/sitemap output is escaped, icon upload is
  type+kind-whitelisted. Fixed stale docs/comments only: corrected the `themes.ts` header to the
  per-palette model, the CHECKLIST "Clean unused → Check unused" (read-only) line, README feature
  list (palettes/PWA/time-machine/icons) + Blob prefixes, and the ARCHITECTURE data model
  (`revisions/`, `files/`, per-palette settings) + theming/PWA design notes
- **feat(theme): visitor palette switcher (6 palettes) on public + admin headers** — like the
  dark/light toggle but for color palette. `PaletteToggle` writes `<html data-palette>` +
  localStorage; `themesToCss` emits every palette's vars so switching is instant (no reload), and
  a no-FOUC script applies the saved palette before paint. Mode (light/dark) × palette are now
  orthogonal axes
- **feat(settings): every palette is independently customizable** — admin color editor now edits
  ANY of the 6 palettes (picker = which one you're editing), each saved under `settings.themes`;
  "Set as default" picks the visitor default; per-mode reset restores that palette's built-in
  colors. Replaces the old single `theme` (auto-migrated into the default palette on read)
- **fix(settings): favicon / app icon upload moved out of the media library** to a dedicated
  `files/` store (`POST /api/files/upload`, `lib/files.ts`, `IconUpload`). **Accepts `.ico`** (the
  media library rejected it) plus PNG/SVG/JPG/WebP/GIF; site icons no longer clutter the grid

## 2026-06-21
- **feat(pwa): installable app on iPhone + Android** — add to the home screen and launch
  standalone (full-screen, no browser chrome). Dynamic `app/manifest.ts` (name/theme/icon from
  settings) + apple-touch-icon + `appleWebApp` + per-mode `theme-color` (`generateViewport`).
  New **App icon** picker in Settings (next to the favicon); icon resolves appIcon → favicon →
  bundled `public/app-icon.png`. **Installable + standalone only — no service worker / no
  offline** (kept thin on purpose; admin & API are never cached). `resolveAppIcon` in settings.ts
- **feat(settings): 6 built-in color presets** (Mono / Sepia / Forest / Ocean / Rosé / Amber),
  each a full light+dark palette tuned for readable contrast in both modes (`lib/themes.ts`).
  Appearance now opens with a palette picker (live light/dark preview swatches); selecting one
  fills both modes, and `settings.themePreset` remembers the choice so each mode's "reset"
  restores THAT preset's colors. Every color stays fully editable + savable after picking;
  the public site still renders only `theme` via `themeToCss`, so nothing is hardcoded
- **change(media): replaced the destructive "Clean unused" button with a read-only "Check
  unused" audit** (`GET /api/media/unused`, `lib/media-usage.ts`; removed `lib/sweep.ts` +
  `POST /api/media/sweep`). It badges media referenced by no post/page/settings in the grid
  and offers a "show unused only" filter — the owner deletes by hand. Now also scans **revision
  snapshots**, so an image kept only in the time machine is no longer flagged (the old sweeper
  ignored revisions and could permanently delete an image a restore still needed)
- **fix(admin): header wordmark/menu now share one h-9 box → perfectly aligned.** Removed the
  `v0.x.y` badge from beside the logo; the running version (now a link to GitHub releases)
  lives only on the Overview page. Alignment rule documented in CLAUDE.md (no more baseline drift)
- **feat(admin): media library shows each image's resolution** (`w×h`). Uploads now capture
  dimensions for svg/gif/webp too (not just jpg/png); `backfill-media-dimensions.mjs` filled the
  existing library (45 images)
- docs: corrected the changelog dates — entries had drifted into the future (up to 06-25);
  remapped to the real git timeline (work happened 06-19 → 06-21 only)
- **docs: added `ROADMAP.md`** (Vercel-or-Docker from one codebase, publishing from Markdown
  note apps, optional AI assist) and refreshed the guidance files for self-hosters: README
  stack/versions + Node 20.9+ requirement + roadmap pointer, and corrected the stale
  "full purge on every save" wording in README/ARCHITECTURE to the current scoped
  invalidation (`src/lib/revalidate.ts`). Added an `engines.node` field to `package.json`.

- **feat(admin): manage categories & tags (new Phân loại tab).** A third tab on the content
  dashboard lists every category and tag with its usage count and lets you **rename** (merges
  into an existing term) or **remove** it across ALL posts in one action (`updateTerm` →
  `POST /api/taxonomy`, owner-only; rewrites each affected `.md` + the index, then full purge)
- **feat(admin): open-in-new-tab row action.** Each published post/page row gets an
  open-in-new-tab icon (left of edit) → its public URL; drafts omit it (would 404)
- **fix(admin): mobile-friendly content tables.** Secondary columns now hide on small screens
  (posts: date `sm`, categories `md`; pages: slug `sm`) so Title + Status + actions always fit
  and the status pill never wraps awkwardly. The tab + new-post row wraps on mobile too
- **fix(admin): header alignment + bigger logo.** The `vibeblog` wordmark, its `v0.x.y` badge
  and the menu now share one vertically-centred line (was baseline-misaligned)
- **fix(admin): header polish.** Wordmark enlarged to logo size (`text-xl`); the version
  (`v0.7.5`) sits next to it and links to GitHub releases (replaces the removed footer link).
  Every header item now shares a fixed-height (`h-9`) `ADMIN_NAV` box so the row stays
  perfectly aligned on one line (fixes the recurring "menu not lined up" drift)
- **feat(admin): cleaner, responsive header + no footer.** The admin top bar is now one
  uniform row of text links: a `vibeblog` wordmark (bold `blog`) replaces the old bold
  "Quản trị" brand; the first nav link is now **Trang chủ** (was "Quản trị"). The three
  right-side controls (theme, clear-cache, sign-out) are styled as the SAME text links as the
  menu — no longer button-shaped — and the theme control shows the applied theme as a **word**
  instead of a sun/moon icon. On mobile the whole menu collapses behind a **hamburger** toggle
  instead of spilling inline. Removed the `vibeblog vX · changelog` admin footer. New
  `AdminHeader` client component; `ADMIN_NAV` shared style; `ThemeToggle` gains `variant='text'`;
  `CacheButton` gains a `className`. Locale key `navAdmin` → `navHome` (all 6 languages)
- **feat(seo): richer robots.txt policy.** Replaces the bare allow-all with three groups:
  major search engines + reputable AI assistants (Googlebot/Bingbot…, GPTBot/ClaudeBot/
  PerplexityBot/Google-Extended…, paired with `/llms.txt`) are explicitly allowed; aggressive
  SEO/data scrapers (`BAD_BOTS`: AhrefsBot, SemrushBot, MJ12bot, DotBot, PetalBot, Bytespider…)
  get `Disallow: /` to save crawl budget/bandwidth; `*` stays welcoming so unknown good bots
  (incl. new AI crawlers) keep working. Bot lists are editable consts atop `app/robots.ts`.
  Still gated by `seo.robots`; `/admin` + `/api` always off-limits
- **docs(claude): document media portability / no vendor lock-in.** New "Portability"
  section in CLAUDE.md: content is stored vendor-host-free (store-relative refs), the vanity
  domain already fronts media, Vercel coupling is isolated to `src/lib/blob.ts`, and a
  step-by-step path to migrate to an S3-compatible store (e.g. Cloudflare R2) without
  rewriting content or breaking public URLs
- chore(release): pre-release audit — `build`, `lint`, `tsc` all clean; verified every
  write/delete API route is owner-gated; removed an unused var in `remap-original-images.mjs`

## 2026-06-20
- **feat(seo): dynamic OG cards for the home, category and tag pages** (same card as
  posts/pages). Home: top line = domain, bottom = site description. Category: top line = the
  name; tag: top line = `#name` (the # marks it as a tag); both bottom = domain. Honors the
  dynamic-OG toggle + fallback image like the rest;
  new `ogCardUrl`/`siteDomain` helpers in `lib/og.ts`. The OG `site` line is now length-capped
- **fix(blog): desktop table-of-contents pinned to the viewport's left edge (50px in).**
  It was absolutely positioned against the centered content column's left edge, so wide /
  full-bleed images broke out into the gutter and overlapped it. Now `fixed` to the viewport,
  vertically centred (clears header/footer), with a max-height scroll for long lists
- **fix(admin): even header action cluster.** The "Clear cache" button was missing `text-sm`
  (oversized text) and changed width while busy (the `…` suffix), making it look lopsided next
  to the nav. Clear-cache + sign-out now share one `HEADER_ACTION` class constant
  (`components/admin/headerActions.ts`) so they can't drift again; busy state is shown by
  dimming, not a width-changing label. Convention added to CLAUDE.md
- **refactor(cache): all invalidation centralized in `src/lib/revalidate.ts` + scoped purges.**
  Edits now apply reliably and without dumping the whole site each time: a new post refreshes
  only the list/taxonomy surfaces (home, pagination, every category/tag page, feed/sitemap/llms)
  and leaves other post bodies warm; editing/deleting a post also refreshes its own page;
  editing a static page touches just its URL + sitemap; settings still purge the whole site and
  now re-warm it. Each helper is a deliberate SUPERSET of affected surfaces, so a change is
  never under-purged (the old "applies late" bug). One accepted minor staleness: the related-
  posts box on other posts (self-heals ≤1h, or use "Clear all cache")
- **fix(admin): editor save now calls `router.refresh()`** (PostForm + PageForm, matching
  SettingsView) so the client Router Cache is dropped — saves show on the next navigation
  instead of lagging behind a stale RSC. Pairs with the `staleTimes` config fix below
- **feat(security): baseline security response headers on every route** (`next.config.ts`
  `headers()`): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy:
  strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy` (camera/mic/geo/topics off). HSTS is
  already added by Vercel. CSP deliberately deferred (needs nonces + Report-Only rollout for
  the inline theme script + Analytics + OG + Blob images)
- fix(config): `experimental.staleTimes.static` was set to `0`, which Next 16 rejects (min 30)
  and silently ignored — leaving static routes on the ~5min client-cache default. Set to `30`
  (lowest accepted), so soft-nav freshness now matches the documented intent
- **refactor(cache): ISR pages + full purge on save (replaces the earlier force-dynamic).**
  Public pages are ISR-cached again for speed (`revalidate = 3600`; `/[slug]` prerendered via
  `generateStaticParams`), but every admin write now calls a single `revalidatePath('/',
  'layout')` that purges the WHOLE site — so an edit (content, theme/background, anything) is
  live on the next request. Reliable this time because it's ONE cache layer (no
  `unstable_cache`), the Full Route Cache is per-deployment (no cross-deploy stale), and Blob
  reads are `?ts`-busted (fresh on every regeneration). `blob.ts` reads switched from
  `cache: 'no-store'` to `{ next: { revalidate } }` so pages can be ISR-cached
- fix(settings): changing site settings (e.g. background color) now applies immediately —
  the save purges the cached layout/theme site-wide
- feat(admin): "Clear all cache" button is back and actually works — purges everything
  (`revalidatePath('/', 'layout')`) then warms the home + newest detail pages (`/api/cache/clear`)
- admin is fully `force-dynamic` (uncached) so the editor/media/settings always reflect the
  current Blob state; client Router Cache fully off (`staleTimes { dynamic: 0, static: 0 }`)

- **refactor(cache): removed the data cache entirely — content is now always fresh.**
  `unstable_cache` + tag revalidation kept fighting Blob's read-after-write and serving
  stale content (new posts missing, **deleted media reappearing**, settings not applying,
  cross-deploy Data Cache persistence). Replaced with: reads use `React.cache()` only
  (request-scoped dedup), and every public page + SEO route is `force-dynamic`. An edit
  now shows on the next plain reload — no rebuild, no "Clear cache" step
- removed the admin "Clear cache" button and `/api/cache/clear` (no cache to clear); the
  `/[slug]` page is no longer SSG (`generateStaticParams` dropped) — it renders fresh;
  dropped all cache-key versioning. Blob store confirmed in Singapore beside the functions
- fix(media): deleting an image in the library now sticks (it was the data cache re-serving
  the old manifest after the delete) — addressed by the always-fresh reads above

- fix(media): inserted images that didn't show. A `<picture>` gives NO fallback when a
  chosen `<source>` 404s, but `PostContent` emitted AVIF/WebP sources for every jpg/png
  *by convention* — so any image whose deferred variants weren't generated rendered blank.
  Now `<picture>` is emitted ONLY for originals whose variants are confirmed (media index
  `variants:true`, passed to `PostContent`); everything else is a plain `<img>` of the
  original, which always loads. Save routes also `revalidateTag('media')` so the
  optimized `<picture>` appears once variants exist. Existing broken posts self-heal
- fix(type): body text now renders at full weight — removed `-webkit-font-smoothing:
  antialiased` (body + the `<html>` `antialiased` class) which thinned glyphs and made
  reading look lighter than the old blog; dropped the negative body `letter-spacing`
  (-0.011em) that cramped accented Vietnamese. Font stays Inter; heading tracking kept
- fix(media): uploads were intermittently failing ("lúc ăn lúc không"). Root causes
  fixed: (1) the whole multi-file upload now does ONE read-modify-write of the manifest
  (`addMediaBatch`) instead of one per file, removing the lost-update race that dropped
  entries; (2) collision naming (`logo` → `logo-2`) now checks the ACTUAL store
  (`listBlobs`) ∪ manifest, so a stale manifest read can't pick a name that already
  exists; (3) `uploadFile` sets `allowOverwrite` as a final safety net so a re-upload
  never hard-throws "blob already exists"
- fix(editor): dragging an image into the editor now inserts reliably — the drop handler
  read a stale (null) editor from its capture closure; it now uses a live `editorRef`.
  Multiple dropped images upload sequentially and insert in order
- feat(seo): pagination is now path-based — `/page/2`, `/category/x/page/2`,
  `/tag/x/page/2` (was `?page=2`). Page 1 stays at the bare path; out-of-range or `/page/1`
  → 404 (no duplicate-content URLs). New `parsePathPage`; shared `BlogListing` component
- feat(read): blog list now shows reading time per post (gated by the readingTime
  feature). `readingMinutes` is computed from the body at save and stored in the index;
  `backfill-reading-time.mjs` filled it for existing posts. Index cache key → `v3`
- fix(ui): single post/page title now uses the same type scale as the blog-list title
  (one title format)

- feat(media): defer heavy variant encoding to save-time — drop/upload stores only the original + thumbnail (`variants:false`); the AVIF/WebP @1024/1600 set is generated by `finalizeContentMedia` on post/page save, only for images kept in the content (an image dropped then discarded never pays the AVIF encode). Save routes get `maxDuration=60`
- feat(media): "Clean unused" library button (`POST /api/media/sweep`, `lib/sweep.ts`) deletes media referenced by no post/page/settings — clears orphans
- feat(media): responsive image pipeline — jpg/png keep the **untouched original** + auto-generate `-1024`/`-1600` in **AVIF + WebP** + a `-thumb.webp`; `PostContent` renders `<picture>` so the browser auto-picks the lightest format/size. Library shows resolution + "download original"; delete removes all variants. svg/gif/webp stored as-is. HEIC dropped. Upload route `maxDuration=60`
- migration(blob): moved store to Singapore (`sin1`) — copied all blobs, collapsed stored URLs to pathnames, swapped `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (all envs), bumped cache keys for a clean cutover; media refs now store-relative end to end
- refactor(blob): store image refs **store-relative** (pathnames, not absolute URLs). `collapseBlob` on write / `expandBlob` on read in the data layer (posts/pages/settings); UI unchanged. Removes storeId lock-in — switching Blob store/region/provider needs no content rewrite. Idempotent, backward-compatible (old absolute URLs self-heal on next save)
- perf(region): `vercel.json` pins functions to `sin1` (Singapore) — was running in `iad1` (US-East), ~200ms from Vietnam; Singapore is ~40ms (Blob store also moved to Singapore, see above)

- feat(i18n): 4 new UI languages — German, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean (now en/vi/de/ja/zh/ko); **English is the default**
- refactor(i18n): strings moved to `src/locales/{<code>,admin/<code>}.ts`; `langs.ts` is the single source of truth (`SITE_LANGS` + `isSiteLang`); `satisfies` enforces every key in every language; `formatDate` is now Intl-per-locale (vi keeps custom form); language picker wraps
- fix(admin): language switch is now instant (optimistic `I18nProvider` state), no longer waits for the save round-trip
- fix(i18n): localize ~32 strings that were hardcoded Vietnamese (settings cards, reader-feature toggles, SEO fields, time machine, editor toasts) — they now translate in all 6 languages
- feat(admin): "Clear cache" button in the header (purges every data-cache tag + reloads) for an immediate "see my changes now" escape hatch

- feat(admin): clearer theme colour picker. The native `<input type="color">` swatch was tiny
  with default chrome, so it didn't read as clickable — enlarged it and stripped the inner
  padding/border so it's one clean colour chip. Clicking it opens the browser's full picker
  (2D area + hue + HEX); the hex field is now monospace/uppercase alongside.
- refactor(theme): every public-UI colour now comes from the theme tokens — no hardcoded
  `neutral-*`/`white`/`black`. Exposed `--c-*` as Tailwind utilities (`bg-bg`, `text-text`,
  `text-heading`, `text-meta`, `text-link`, `border-rule`) via `@theme inline`. **All lines +
  faint surfaces (TOC border, dropdowns, header/footer, code blocks, hovers, preview banner) use
  `--c-rule`**, so one colour in Admin → Giao diện drives them. Also fixes a dark-mode bug where
  code blocks stayed light (hardcoded `#f4f4f2` had no dark override).
- fix(editor): over-spaced bullet/numbered list items. TipTap wraps each item's content in a
  `<p>`, which inherited the 1.4em paragraph margin — items now sit tight + even (only genuine
  multi-paragraph items keep spacing). Shared `.prose` rule, so the editor matches the render.
- feat(editor): rounded out the toolbar to match standard markdown editors — **numbered list**,
  **task list** (GFM `- [ ]`, renders as checkboxes), **inline code**, **horizontal rule**, and
  **insert table** (the Table extension had no way to create one from the UI). Added the TipTap
  **Placeholder** extension so the empty-state hint actually shows (the old root `data-placeholder`
  rendered nothing). New deps: `@tiptap/extension-task-list`, `-task-item`, `-placeholder`.

- feat(admin): **Media domain (CDN)** field in Settings → SEO (`mediaBaseUrl`) — set a vanity
  host for public media URLs from the UI instead of an env var. Owner setting wins, falls back
  to `BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE`; pushed into the Blob layer via `setMediaBase()` on each settings read.
  New admin i18n keys `mediaDomain`/`mediaDomainHint` (all 6 locales). Data-layer reads
  (`posts`/`pages`/`media`) now prime `getSettings()` before `expandBlob`, so the field alone
  drives media URLs reliably (no cold-start ordering race) — the env var is no longer required
- fix(header): render the logo with a plain `<img>` instead of `next/image`. The optimizer
  only allows hosts whitelisted in `next.config` at build time, so a runtime-configurable media
  domain (Settings → Media domain / a Cloudflare Worker) made the optimized logo 404. A plain
  tag loads from whatever host the setting yields — no build coupling, no env, never breaks on a
  domain change. Logos are small + CDN-cached, so the lost optimization is negligible
- feat(seo): `/sitemaps.xml` 308-redirects to `/sitemap.xml` (alias for the plural form / old
  search-console submissions; no second sitemap to keep in sync)
- feat(media): optional vanity domain for public media URLs via `BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE` (e.g. a
  Cloudflare Worker on `files.<domain>` proxying the Blob store). `publicBase()` rewrites only
  rendered media URLs (`expandBlob` + `blobOrigin` preconnect); internal data reads stay on the
  store host (no proxy hop, `?ts` cache-bust intact). `collapseBlob` also strips the vanity host
- fix(content): restored 41 broken post images across 19 imported posts. A prior media wipe
  (removed small/resized versions) left these `media/...` refs 404ing. Re-fetched the ORIGINAL
  full-size files from the source WordPress site via the Rocket.net file API (the public domain
  is behind a Cloudflare challenge that blocks direct fetch), stripping WP `-WxH` resize
  suffixes; uploaded to Blob, rewrote the markdown, rebuilt `media/_index.json`. New scripts:
  `check-image-links.mjs` (audit), `remap-original-images.mjs` (recover + remap)
- feat(seo): SEO tab — JSON-LD schema, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, RSS `feed.xml`, dynamic OG image (`/og`, edge runtime), canonical `siteUrl`; all toggleable
- feat(read): client-side `/search` (lean pre-folded index), table of contents (desktop, sticky), reading-progress bar, related posts, reading time
- feat(admin): `Tính năng` tab — toggle reader features (search/toc/related/readingTime/progressBar); `Link nháp` HMAC draft-preview links (`/preview/[slug]`)
- feat: `@vercel/analytics`; themed `(blog)/not-found.tsx`
- perf: every Blob read wrapped in `unstable_cache` (tags posts/pages/media/settings) → `/[slug]` is now real SSG; `staleTimes { dynamic: 0, static: 180 }`; logo via `next/image`; modern `browserslist` drops legacy-JS polyfills; editor serialization debounced
- fix: public reads degrade to fallback instead of 500; bump `getSettings` cache key (Data Cache persists across deploys)
- refactor(dry): consolidate 3 toggle components into `ui/Switch.tsx`; one `<hr>` divider standard (50% left); no all-caps; drop dead classes
- docs: add `ARCHITECTURE.md`; refresh README caching/usage
- perf: replace `resolveUrl` (`list()` API call) with direct `blobUrl()` — halves Blob read latency
- perf: `getPublicPosts`, `getSettings`, `getPublicPages` cached via `unstable_cache` — cross-request cache with tag-based invalidation
- perf: `getPost` / `getPage` wrapped with `React.cache()` — deduplicates generateMetadata + page render calls
- perf: `[slug]/page.tsx` — `generateStaticParams` + `dynamicParams = true` for ISR (falls back to dynamic due to `revalidate: 0` Blob fetches, but structure is correct)
- perf: all admin write routes call `revalidateTag` / `revalidatePath` after save/delete
- fix: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` regex corrected to `vercel_blob_rw_` (was `vercelblob_rw_`)
- feat: `next.config.ts` — added Vercel Blob image remote patterns
- docs: CLAUDE.md expanded with Blob access, caching model, ISR, data layer reference, scripts
